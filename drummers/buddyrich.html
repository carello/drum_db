Bernard "Buddy" Rich (September 30, 1917 â€“ April 2, 1987) was an American jazz drummer and bandleader.<br>

<p>Rich was billed as "the world's greatest drummer" during his career.<br>
He performed with many bandleaders, most notably Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, Count Basie,<br>
and led his own "Buddy Rich Big Band"</p>

<p>At age 11, he was performing as a bandleader.<br>
He received no formal drum instruction and went so far as to claim that instruction would<br>
only degrade his musical talent. He also never admitted to practicing,<br>
claiming to play the drums only during performances[4] and was not known to read music.</p>
